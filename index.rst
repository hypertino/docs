Introduction
============

Hypertino is a framework, set of conventions, protocols, libraries and services that allows you to create a modern backend in Scala.

This framework was created with the following principles and concepts in mind but not limited to:

	- SRP and DRY;
	- Loose coupling;
	- ESB;
	- REST;
	- Scalability;
	- API modeling and specification;

The mission of framework is to share in a community as much as possible useful code in a form that is reusable and maintainable by many.
